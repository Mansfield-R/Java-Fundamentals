<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I'm currently studying for the OCA exam to help accelerate my career switch into backend development instead of automated test
engineer. I'll be uploading my progress into this repository as well as documenting anywhere I am having trouble understanding.
Most coding challenges will be from Tim Buchalka's course on
[udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/), but some will be from leetcode.
